                <h3>Problem In The World:</h3>
                <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
                <p>
                    A problem that we have in this world is obesity. The reason why we have obesity in the world is that people
                    are unhealthy and they donâ€™t exercise. There are many causes of obesity. One of the biggest causes of
                    obesity is unhealthy foods. Many foods sold in grocery stores and fast-food restaurants are manufactured
                    and contain a lot of substances that are harmful to the human body. This being the case prices for junk
                    foods are significantly lower than healthier options. This enables low-income families to buy healthier
                    foods for them self and so they end up going for the not so healthy but cheaper options.

                <h3>How To Solve The Problem:</h3>
                <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
                <p>
                    The way to solve this problem in the world and make it a better place is by making healthier foods more
                    affordable for all. A few other ways that we can decrease the obesity rate in the world is by having more
                    local and organic food that is healthier in replacement of junk food in grocery stores. Another thing that
                    we can do is have the gym be free. I say this because gyms are expensive and that enables a lot of people
                    from wanting to exercise. If gyms were free more people would go and workout. Overall, decreasing obesity
                    in the world will improve the health of all and fewer people would go to the doctors for health risks.
